After setting up the Frontend and Backend locally follow the below mentioned steps to raise a PR.
    
1. Create a new branch and checkout to it in your forked repo with name as GitHubUsername/#IssueNumber using `git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME`. 
Example: If I'm working on issue no. 12 then my branch name would be kunaljain0212/#12.
2. Make your changes on this branch, and then stage you changed using `git add .` command.
3. Commit your changes with a meaningful commit msg using `git commit -m"MESSAGE"`.
4. Push your changes to your branch using `git push origin BRANCH_NAME`.
5. Raise a PR from your forked repo to the main repo and reference the issue number in the PR message.
6. Wait for the PR to get merged :tada::tada:.
